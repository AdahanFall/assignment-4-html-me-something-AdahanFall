         <h1>A sample list of some of the subreddits that I subscribe to.</h1>
         <p>This isn't a complete list. I just wanted to pick a few things that I thought were representative of the things I like. Also, I get severe writer's block unless given a very specific topic to talk about (I have literally spent hours looking at a blank screen before when given too much freedom in a writing assignment), and this is what a friend told me to do.</p>

      <h1><a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/chess>Chess</a></h1>

      <p>I'm not going to lie and say that I'm any good at the game, but I love solving chess puzzles and enjoy watching the experts play and seeing analysis of their games. I'm going to be honest. I don't understand a lot of the really deep analysis... Mostly I just struggle with the puzzles that are posted and marvel at how good Magnus Carlsen is, just like everyone else. As a deep cut, sometimes it's fun to take a side trip over to /r/anarchychess.</p>

      <h1><a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/GreenBayPackers>Green Bay Packers</a></h1>

      <p>I may not be a huge fan of the NFL anymore (especially with with they treated the city of St. Louis), but I was born in Wisconsin and I inherited this fandom from my family. I'll always have a soft spot in my heart for this team. I absolutely love their odd origin story, and their status as a community-owned non-profit team that exists despite the insane corporate influence of the NFL.</p>

      <h1><a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch>Overwatch</a></h1>

      <p>I don't play this game nearly as much as I used to. Part of it is the fact that it's gotten stale. Part of it is because I don't have much time to game anymore. And yet another part of it is some of the news stories that have come out about working conditions there... But I still keep this sub in my subscriptions, and check out the PotGs that people post every now and then.</p>

      <h1><a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/StLouis>St. Louis</a></h1>
      <img src=images/stlouis.png alt="St. Louis Subreddit banner" height =150>
      <p>Because sometimes I want to see people complaining about the STLPD, the Metrolink, provel cheese, and whatever else is going on in the area. I might not be a &quot;true St-Louisan&quot; because I was born in Wisconsin, but I've been in the area for almost 20 years and I'm glad to be here.</p>

      <h1><a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames>Board Games</a></h1>
      <img src=images/boardgames.png alt="Board Games Subreddit banner" height=150>
      <p>Because I'm seriously thinking of thinking one of those huge 6x6 Kallax shelves from Ikea to house my collection of games. Yeah, I already list /r/chess as one of my subs, but this is a bit different. This encompasses the entire field of Euro-style games. The pandemic has made it a bit harder to find groups to play with, but it's still fun to get a group of your close (and vaccinated) friends together around the gaming table.</p>
